## Codebase Patterns
- `apps/web/src/components/shell/AppShell.tsx` owns top nav + drawer source of truth via shared `NAV_ITEMS`; route highlights derive from `pathname` prefix checks.
- `apps/web/src/components/module/ModuleView.tsx` is the shared unimplemented-module scaffold; pass `actionSlot` to provide a concrete next-step entry in the learning loop.

- What was implemented
  - Aligned M1 navigation skeleton to `Study`, `Practice`, `Analyze`, `Reports`, and `AI Coach` routes.
  - Updated `/app` index redirect to `/app/study`.
  - Made module placeholder state explicit and added loop-forward next-step links on all required M1 pages.
- Files changed
  - `apps/web/src/components/shell/AppShell.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/module/ModuleView.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/study/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/practice/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/analyze/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/reports/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/ai-coach/history/page.tsx`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - Keep route labels, header title resolution, and active highlighting bound to one shared nav list to avoid route drift.
    - Use `ModuleView` `actionSlot` for cross-route continuation CTAs instead of custom page-local placeholder implementations.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - Browser verification tooling (`dev-browser` skill) is unavailable in this environment, so manual browser verification is required.
  - Useful context
    - `@poker-god/web` currently exposes `typecheck` and `build`; there is no dedicated `lint` script yet.
