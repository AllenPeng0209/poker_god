## Codebase Patterns
- `apps/web/src/components/shell/AppShell.tsx` owns top nav + drawer source of truth via shared `NAV_ITEMS`; route highlights derive from `pathname` prefix checks.
- `apps/web/src/components/module/ModuleView.tsx` is the shared unimplemented-module scaffold; pass `actionSlot` to provide a concrete next-step entry in the learning loop.
- For filterable UI lists in `apps/web`, define a typed dataset module and derive filter options from dataset unique values to keep controls/schema in sync.
- For detail panes driven by filtered lists, keep `selectedId` state but always derive a fallback item from current filtered results to avoid transient blank states during filter/selection updates.

## 2026-02-13 13:29:11 CST - US-001
- What was implemented
  - Aligned M1 navigation skeleton to `Study`, `Practice`, `Analyze`, `Reports`, and `AI Coach` routes.
  - Updated `/app` index redirect to `/app/study`.
  - Made module placeholder state explicit and added loop-forward next-step links on all required M1 pages.
- Files changed
  - `apps/web/src/components/shell/AppShell.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/module/ModuleView.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/study/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/practice/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/analyze/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/reports/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/ai-coach/history/page.tsx`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - Keep route labels, header title resolution, and active highlighting bound to one shared nav list to avoid route drift.
    - Use `ModuleView` `actionSlot` for cross-route continuation CTAs instead of custom page-local placeholder implementations.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - Browser verification tooling (`dev-browser` skill) is unavailable in this environment, so manual browser verification is required.
  - Useful context
    - `@poker-god/web` currently exposes `typecheck` and `build`; there is no dedicated `lint` script yet.

## 2026-02-13 13:34:50 CST - US-002
- What was implemented
  - Replaced the Study placeholder with a concrete Spot Library page containing seeded spot data and a typed spot schema.
  - Added `Format`, `Position`, and `Stack (BB)` filters with immediate list + count updates on every filter change.
  - Rendered each result with structured `format`, `position`, `stack_bb`, and `street` fields to satisfy the Study spot schema contract.
- Files changed
  - `apps/web/src/app/app/study/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/study/studySpots.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/components/study/StudySpotBrowser.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - Keep filter option lists derived from source data instead of hardcoded values to avoid schema/filter drift.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - JSX text containing `>` (for example `->`) can break TSX parsing; use plain text wording instead.
    - Browser verification tooling (`dev-browser` skill) is unavailable in this environment, so manual browser verification is required.
  - Useful context
    - For this repository’s web package, `typecheck` and `build` are the available quality gates; no `lint` or `test` script is defined yet.

## 2026-02-13 13:57:34 CST - US-003
- What was implemented
  - Added node-level Study detail data (`strategy`, `ranges`, `breakdown`) to every spot and surfaced node identifiers/metrics in the UI.
  - Implemented clickable spot selection with a stable node-detail inspector that keeps content populated while filters and node selection change.
  - Added `Strategy`, `Ranges`, and `Breakdown` tabs in node detail, each rendering structured metrics and lists.
- Files changed
  - `apps/web/src/components/study/studySpots.ts`
  - `apps/web/src/components/study/StudySpotBrowser.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`
  - `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
  - `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Patterns discovered
    - Node detail UIs should keep selected-id state plus filtered fallback derivation to prevent blank detail panels during rapid filter transitions.
  - Gotchas encountered
    - Browser verification tooling (`dev-browser` skill) is unavailable in this environment, so manual browser verification is required.
  - Useful context
    - `@poker-god/web` quality gates remain `typecheck` and `build`; no dedicated `lint` or `test` script exists yet.
