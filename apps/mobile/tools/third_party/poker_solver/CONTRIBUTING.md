# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Please read `AGENTS.md` before making changes. It captures the repo structure, coding conventions, and testing expectations.

Quick checklist:

- Keep Python as the reference implementation; validate correctness there first.
- Include reproducible commands for runs or benchmarks.
- Add tests for new algorithms or bug fixes where practical.
- Avoid committing build artifacts or large generated files.
